# Depot Notes

Depot Notes provides quick copy-ready snippets for Depot documentation workflows. You can now load `welcome.html` to choose between:

- **Version 3 (`index.html`)** – the redesigned guided stepper experience.
- **Version 2 (`index-v2.html`)** – the classic layout that mirrors the legacy workflow.
- **Quick Survey (`quick-survey.html`)** – a lightweight checklist for rapid boiler surveys.
- **Thing (`thing.html`)** – an experimental playground for trying new Depot concepts.

Install the app from any supported browser using the **Install Depot Notes** button on the welcome screen. Once installed, Depot Notes works offline, with updates delivered automatically through the service worker.
